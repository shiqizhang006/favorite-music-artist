                        Playing a mini Casio keyboard, My Little Airport creates a “quirky” style of arrangement that immediately catches me. 
                        Their lyrics are the most unique part, which overflows with unpolished emotions delivered by plain language. 
                        Their songs are as short as a playlet but always heart-touching. 
                        They are not only musicians, but also poets, and passive romanticists.

                        This song is called "Let's Leave Together" ("我們一起離開吧"). Translation of the lyrics: "I want to turn into a puppet, I want to turn into a stone, I want to turn into a hill, I want to turn into a dog. 
                        How could we be rid of sorrows? How could we be rid of tears? How could we be rid of self guilt? How could we be free?"
